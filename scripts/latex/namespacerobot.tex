\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb}This class presents a robot api for the da Vinci Research Kit.
Remember that for this program to work, you will need to import the
robot class, this can be done by `import robot` an well as initialize
the robot. For example, if we want to create a robot called `r`, for
robot `PSM1`, we will simply type `r = robot.robot('PSM1')` in iPython
and `r = robot('PSM1')` in python.

.. _interpolate:

Interpolation
=============

If the `interpolation` flag is set to `True` (default), the robot
controller will use a `trajectory generator
<http://ttuadvancedrobotics.wikidot.com/trajectory-planning-for-point-to-point-motion>`_
to create set points between the current position and the position
requested by the user.  If your desired position is "far" from the
current position, you should always set the `interpolate` flag to
`True`.

The only case where you should override the default and set
`interpolate` to `False` is if you are sending positions close to each
other.  For example, when `tele-operating
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleoperation>`_, all the master
positions you will receive will define a continuous trajectory with
positions close to each other.

It is important to note that when `interpolate` is set to `False`,
sending a new goal that is far from the last desired position will
likely trigger a `PID tracking error <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller>`_.

.. _currentvdesired:

Current vs Desired position
===========================

The robot controller can provide two different positions at any given
time.  The current position is the position measured by the sensors
(in most cases, encoders).  This position defines the physical
position of the system.  The desired joint position is the position
sent to the low level controller (e.g. `PID
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller>`_).  The desired
cartesian position is calculted using the desired joint position.
When using a `trajectory
<http://ttuadvancedrobotics.wikidot.com/trajectory-planning-for-point-to-point-motion>`_,
the desired position is not the final goal but the last set point
generated for the trajectory.

Desired positions might differ from the physical positions due to
`forces (gravity, friction, ...) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force>`_ applied on the robot.  When
implementing an incremental move, one should always use the last
desired position.  If one needs to track the robot, it is better to
use the current position.
